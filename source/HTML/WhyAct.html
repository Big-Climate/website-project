        <p><h2 id="Section-One">Hotter Temperatures</h2>Across the globe we are experiencing more frequent hotter days and fewer and fewer colder days.<br/>Hotter days increases the likely hood of drough and wildfires. Increased risk of heat related healthissues such as cardiovascular and respiratory complications and Kidney disease. Agricultar is impacted as crops stuggle to grow in high temperature and livestock suffer from heat stress. In cities, infrastucture absorbs heat making the temperature 2 degrees hotter on average than in outlying areas, buildings are slow to release the heat meaning that temperatures remain high overnight</p>

        <p><h2 id="Section-Two">Severe Weather</h2>The increase in frequency and severety of weather events is one of the easiest ways that we can see the impact og climate change on our planet.<br/>Sever Weather events such as drought, wildfires, flooding, hurricanes and tornadoes have a devestating impact on the areas that they affect. The damage caused by these events have huge associated costs. In 2017 Hurricane Maria caused $111.6 billon worth of damages and claimed 2,981 lives. As climate change progresses the costs of such disasters will only increase.</p>

        <p><h2 id="Section-Three">Extinction</h2>Climate change is causing animals habitat to change faster than they an adapt.<br/>Increasing tempratures at the North Pole are causing the area of sea-ice to shrink each year, threatening the existence animals such as polar bear and seals that rely on it survive. CO2 that is absorbed by the worlds oceans is making the sea-water more acidic, reducing the compounds that crustations use to make the hard shels they need to survive. Scientists predict that is climate change continues unchecked 30% of plants and animals could face extinction by 2050 and up to 70% by the end of the century.</p>

        <p><h2 id="Section-Four">Rising Sea levels</h2>There are two main factor causing the sea levels to rise: added water from melting sea ice; and expansion as temperatures rise.<br/>Rising sea levels are causing beaches and cliffs to erode at a faster rate - the cost is moving inland. Wetland areas are experiencing more frequent flooding putting infrastructure built in these areas ar risk. One of the most serious consiquences of a rising sea levels is the contamination of ground water. Any contact with seawater contaminates freshwater making it unfit for human consumption.</p>

        <p><h2 id="Section-Five">World Hunger</h2>Extreme weather caused by climate change is one of the driving factors of world hunger.<br/> Abnormal weather conditions make it dificult for farmers to know the optimal time to plant or harvest and have an adverse effect on the plants during growth. This leads to lower crop yields than is needed to sustain the population. In Africa 95% of farmers rely on rainy seasons for irrigation. The horn of Africa has experienced 4 consecutive failed rainy seasons and the next one is expected to fail as well. The lack of rain in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia is the worst in at least the last 70 years and has lead to half of Somalias population being considered food insecure.</p>

        <p><h2 id="Section-Six">Poverty and Displacement</h2>The environmental effects of climate change are creating conditions that are forcing people away from their homes.<br/>Many communities world wide are experiencing consecutive disasters that leave them little time to recover before the next catastrophe. People's livelihoods are disrupted and their homes are destroyed and they have little oportiunity to rebuild causing them to relocate instead. The people who are displaced have only what they can carry and put strain on the areas that they move to. Because the displaced communites only tend to move within their country of origin they are not legally considered refugees and are therefore not afforded the same government aid as international refugees. This means it is usually down to humanitaria charities such as the International Red Cross to provide aid.</p>
