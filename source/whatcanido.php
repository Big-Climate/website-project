      <li>Travel light</li>
      <li>Get your vehicle serviced</li>
      <li>Plan your route before traveling</li>
      <p>When traveling by car you need to be careful about your emissions. When idiling in a car you are producing up to twice as many 
          emissions than when in motion, to counteract this you can turn your car off when stopped for an extended time such as a traffic jam 
          or stopped at a red light. This small change in your driving method can help the enviroment stay healthy and keep this planet running.
